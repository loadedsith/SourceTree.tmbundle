# SourceTree.tmbundle
A Textmate bundle for better SourceTree integration.

All credit goes to Brian Schlining and his blog post http://hohonuuli.blogspot.com/2015/04/opening-sourcetree-from-textmate.html. All I did was make a repo.

Installation should be as easy as downloading the repo and double clicking on the folder. You may have to change the file name to SourceTree.tmbundle
